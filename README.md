## Features

- **Semantic Search:** Utilizes Sentence Transformers to generate embeddings for search queries.
- **Vector Database Integration:** Employs Pinecone for efficient similarity searches within a large dataset of YouTube video transcripts.
- **Scalable and Efficient:** Designed to handle multiple queries with minimal latency.
- **Secure Configuration:** Manages sensitive information like API keys using environment variables.
- **Logging and Error Handling:** Implements logging for monitoring and debugging purposes.

---

## Technologies Used

- **Backend Framework:** [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/)
- **Sentence Embeddings:** [Sentence Transformers](https://www.sbert.net/)
- **Vector Database:** [Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io/)
- **Environment Management:** [python-dotenv](https://github.com/theskumar/python-dotenv)
- **Others:** Python 3.9+, Git

---

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- **Python 3.9+** is installed on your machine. You can download it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- **Pinecone Account:** Sign up for a Pinecone account [here](https://www.pinecone.io/start/).
- **YouTube Data:** A dataset of YouTube video transcripts should be prepared and upserted into Pinecone under the specified namespace.

---

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/youtube-transcript-search-api.git
cd youtube-transcript-search-api/backend
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment

It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

### 3. Activate the Virtual Environment

- **On macOS/Linux:**

  ```bash
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

- **On Windows:**

  ```bash
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```

### 4. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Configuration

The application requires certain environment variables to function correctly. These variables store sensitive information like API keys.

### 1. Create a `.env` File

Inside the `backend/` directory, create a `.env` file:

```bash
touch .env
```

### 2. Add Environment Variables

Open the `.env` file in your preferred text editor and add the following:

```plaintext
PINECONE_API_KEY=your-pinecone-api-key
PINECONE_ENVIRONMENT=your-pinecone-environment  # e.g., us-east1-gcp
INDEX_NAME=youtube-transcripts-embeddings
NAMESPACE=youtube-transcripts-embeddings
FLASK_ENV=development
PORT=5000
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important:** Replace `your-pinecone-api-key` and `your-pinecone-environment` with your actual Pinecone API key and environment.

### 3. Secure Your `.env` File

Ensure that the `.env` file is not tracked by Git to protect your sensitive information.

Add `.env` to your `.gitignore`:

```gitignore
# backend/.gitignore

.env
venv/
__pycache__/
*.pyc
```

---

## Running the Application

### 1. Initialize Pinecone and Upsert Data

Before running the Flask application, ensure that your Pinecone index is set up and populated with the YouTube transcript embeddings.

**Note:** The following steps assume you have a script to upsert data into Pinecone (`dataUpsert.py`). Ensure your embeddings are correctly formatted and upserted under the specified namespace.

```bash
python3 dataUpsert.py
```

**Sample Output:**

```plaintext
Index 'youtube-transcripts-embeddings' already exists.
{'dimension': 384, 'index_fullness': 0.0, 'namespaces': {'youtube-transcripts-embeddings': {'vector_count': 143}}, 'total_vector_count': 143}
All embeddings upserted successfully.
```

### 2. Start the Flask Server

With the virtual environment activated and dependencies installed, run the Flask application:

```bash
python3 app.py
```

**Sample Output:**

```plaintext
 * Serving Flask app 'app'
 * Debug mode: on
INFO:root:Index 'youtube-transcripts-embeddings' already exists.
INFO:root:Search successful for query embedding with top_k=5
* Running on http://0.0.0.0:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

**Example with Gunicorn:**

```bash
gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:8000 app:app
```

### 4. Secure the Application

- **Use HTTPS:** Ensure that your application is served over HTTPS.
- **Implement Authentication:** Secure your API endpoints if necessary.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **`NameError: name 'API_KEY' is not defined`**

   - **Cause:** Missing quotes around the environment variable name in `os.getenv()`.
   - **Solution:** Use `os.getenv("API_KEY")` instead of `os.getenv(API_KEY)`.

2. **No Matches Returned**

   - **Ensure that embeddings are correctly upserted into Pinecone under the specified namespace.**
   - **Verify that the namespace in the search query matches the upsert namespace.**
   - **Check the dimensionality of the embeddings to ensure consistency.**

3. **Pinecone Client Initialization Errors**

   - **Ensure that the Pinecone API key and environment are correctly set in the `.env` file.**
   - **Verify that the Pinecone index exists and is correctly connected.**

4. **Model Loading Delays**

   - **Initialize the SentenceTransformer model once at the start to avoid delays during each request.**

5. **CORS Issues**

   - **Ensure that Flask-CORS is correctly configured to allow requests from your frontend domain.**
   - **Adjust the CORS settings as needed for your specific use case.**
